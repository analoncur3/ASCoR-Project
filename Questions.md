# Things to consider
- I have noticed quotation marks being used to question the veracity of the word, i.e. "suppression" instead of suppression. How can we account for this?
- training embedding model: how can we account for contextual semantic differences using a pre-trained model? I remember Monika saying you can tweak models to data of interest, how is this done?

- check Python modules for text analysis and functions associated to each
