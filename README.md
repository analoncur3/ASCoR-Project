## Rationale
- **Sources**: Even in an increasingly hybrid and dynamic media ecosystem where traditional news media and social media blend together, traditional mass media still play an important role in setting the agenda (Langer and Gruber, 2021) and legitimizing, amplifying, and spreading disinformation of topics such as climate change (Merkley and Stecula, 2021), the COVID-19 vaccine (Introne et al., 2020) and election-related conspiracism (Benkler et al., 2020). The selection of news media sources is based on [Faris et al. (2017)](https://cyber.harvard.edu/publications/2017/08/mediacloud) and [Benkler et al. (2020)](https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/37365484/Benkler-etal-Mail-in-Voter-Fraud-Anatomy-of-a-Disinformation-Campaign.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y) studies. 
    - Faris et al. develop a media partisanship scale from behavior of partisan Twitter users during the 2016 US election, i.e. media source sharing patterns of those who retweeted Trump or Clinton. To test the robustness of their findings, they expand the inquiry to the partisan proclivities of the supporters of other GOP candidates and the supporters of Bernie Sanders, finding the two scores to be highly correlated (ρ = 0.97).
    - Benkler et al. analyse over 55,000 online media stories, 5 million tweets, and 75,000 on public Facebook pages garnering millions of engagements to study the disinformation campaign that led to widespread acceptance of false voter fraud beliefs and to its partisan distribution pattern. Contrary to the focus of most contemporary work on disinformation, their findings suggest that this highly effective disinformation campaign was an elite-driven, mass-media led process, with social media playing only a secondary and supportive role. The findings are consistent with their findings about the American political media ecosystem from 2015-2018, published in [Network Propaganda](https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/oso/9780190923624.001.0001/oso-9780190923624), and Faris et al. media partisanship scores.
    - Media partisanship was further validated via [The Allsides Bias Ratings page](https://www.allsides.com/media-bias/ratings?field_featured_bias_rating_value=1&field_news_source_type_tid%5B%5D=2&field_news_bias_nid_1%5B3%5D=3&title=). 

We select mass-market/top news media identified in these studies.

- **Timeframe**: The rate at which states successfully passed voter ID laws increased substantially following the 2013 Supreme Court case [Shelby County v. Holder](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/court-cases/shelby-county-v-holder). In 2013, the preclearance required by states with a history of racial discrimination (section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965) was deamed unconstitutional, which allowed these states to enact voting laws without first getting approval by the Justice Department or a Federal Court. This ruling opened the gates for states, specially those formerly needing federal preclearance, to change their election laws. The screenshot fron NexisUni below shows a similar rapid increase of news media stories about voter ID from 2013.

- **Key terms**: To find appropriate search terms, I used Mediacloud's ‘Explorer’ option to instantly analyse how digital news media covers voter fraud and voter suppression, the two partisan frames identified in the literature. I selected coverage during the 2016 US Presidential campaign period (August 1, 2016 – January 1, 2017), in U.S. Top Online News 2017 (Top 32 news websites of the year by August 2017 in the United States, according to data from comScore, Activate and Alexa) and cross-checked identical words in the top 10 words associated to each query. The presence of ‘voter ID’ and ‘ID’ as top terms in both the search terms “voter fraud” and “voter suppression” suggests using voter ID (and variations of it) as a key search term could be a good approach to identify frames.


## Methodology:
### 1. Data Collection
- We collect urls via MediaCloud API and extract article data in Python using [NewsPlease](https://github.com/fhamborg/news-please)
- We use NexisUni to extract article data in R using [LexisNexisTools](https://github.com/JBGruber/LexisNexisTools)

### 2. Data Pre-processing
- Remove irrelevant words
- Remove stopwords
- Remove words with low IDF scores
- Compound common bigrams and names
- Combine terms: id and identification, gov and government
- Treat "suppression" as no_suppression

### 3. Data exploration
- Count articles per media ideology
- Count articles per congressional session
- Count articles per day
- Word counts

### 4. Analysis
#### Title Analysis
- co-occurrence networks of titles after removing words with low idf scores (very common words used by both media)

#### Overall Corpus/text Analysis (to find key topics / events / narratives structuring the voter ID debate)
- Compare how the significance of key terms changes over time through tf-idf scores per month (data: right and left).
- Shifterator analysis comparing left vs right leaning media to understand significant terms defining coverage from each set of media.
- Networks displaying shifterator metrics 

#### Voter ID
- word embeddings for right and left media to find words in the context of 'id'.
